# ember/no-tracked-properties-from-args

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Disallow creation of @tracked properties from args.

## Rule Details

This rule disallows the creation of @tracked properties with values from `this.args`. The @tracked property will not be updated when the args change, which is almost never what you want. Instead, use a getter to derive the desired state.
If you need to modify a specific arg, consider having the parent provide a way for the child component to update it. This avoids having two sources of truth that you will need to keep in sync.

## Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
class Example {
    @tracked someValue = this.args.someValue;
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
class Example {
    get someValue() {
        return this.args.someValue;
    }
}
```
