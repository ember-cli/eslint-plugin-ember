# ember/prefer-ember-test-helpers

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the âœ… `recommended` [config](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember#-configurations).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This rule ensures the correct Ember test helper is imported when using methods that have a native window counterpart.

There are currently 3 Ember test helper methods that have a native window counterpart:

- blur
- find
- focus

If these methods are not properly imported from Ember's test-helpers suite, and the native window method version is used instead, any intended asynchronous functions won't work as intended, which can cause tests to fail silently.

## Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
test('foo', async (assert) => {
  await blur('.some-element');
});
```

```js
test('foo', async (assert) => {
  await find('.some-element');
});
```

```js
test('foo', async (assert) => {
  await focus('.some-element');
});
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
import { blur } from '@ember/test-helpers';

test('foo', async (assert) => {
  await blur('.some-element');
});
```

```js
import { find } from '@ember/test-helpers';

test('foo', async (assert) => {
  await find('.some-element');
});
```

```js
import { focus } from '@ember/test-helpers';

test('foo', async (assert) => {
  await focus('.some-element');
});
```
